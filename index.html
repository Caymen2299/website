          <p class="card-text home-text">Hello! My name is Caymen Carter and welcome to my website. I am currently a Junior at SUNY Polytchnic Institute pursuing a Bachelors degree and Masters degree in computer science. 
            In addition to programming I also like to do a bunch of other fun things like snowboarding, surfing, guitar, and photography. 
          </p>

          <p class="card-text home-text">  
            Out of all my hobbies, snowboarding is the one I have been doing the longest and it has become a big part of who I am.
            However, I am only able to snowboard during the winter season and so I try to substitiute in surfing or longboarding in the other seasons. 
          </p>

          <p class="card-text home-text">
            Another hobby that has become a big part of who I am and has me currently employed is photography. 
            I have been doing photography for around 6 years and I am currently a photgrapher for the Genesis Yearbook Orginization. 
          </p>

          <p class="card-text home-text">
            I love learning new things and I recently got into learning guitar with the help of some of my friends. I'm not very good yet but I try to practice when I'm not doing any of my other hobbies or updating and improving this website.
               
          </p>
          <p class="card-text home-text">
              The main purpose of creating this website was to host my resume. However, as I have been putting it together I have found that I have learned so much and had a lot of fun along the way. 
              I plan to keep expanding and improving this website to hold all my photography, projects, education contact information, and maybe even some games once the base website is finished. 
          </p>

          <p class="card-text home-text"><medium class="">I am currently looking for any jobs or internships in the computer science field. 
            If you are interested, please check out the education page for my qualifications as well as the contact page for my resume and contact information.
          </medium></p>
